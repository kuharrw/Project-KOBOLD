# Project-KOBOLD
Digital sign in application for Amtgard

A project originating from The Kingdom of the Rising Winds
Development lead by Raten Firewalker

The applications allows you to create events (which could be an actual event, or just a single park day) and take sign ins for it.

When finished taking sign ins, tap and hold the event on the home screen to bring up a menu of additional options. From there you can export the sign in sheet as a .CSV file and send it via email. You can also edit the event from the menu to complete it, removing it from the list.

New in version 1.3

-New fields in events, allowing for default park and kingdom (especially useful for new players who don't know what to put)
-New field in events, allows fields that are not relevant to park days to be hidden (wristband number, parking pass number, essentially everything after Kingdom)
-Bug fixes for exporting involving event names containing "/" which causes file path issues and "," in sign in fields

New in version 1.1

-New fields added to sign ins. Sign in day (selected from a day of the week, which defaults to the current day), pay exempt, and line number (calculated when the sign in is saved)

-Total sign ins, and total paying sign ins, are displayed at the top of the sign in sheet page and the export
